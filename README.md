# The Team 2 CiE-App
Every year a lot of exchange Students come to the Hochschule MÃ¼nchen to do an exchange year.
 But instead of enjoying their year abroad they first have to face the troubles of finding 
 and selecting fitting lectures for their course. To help both the exchange students as
 well as the Courses in English team we developed an app to make this process easier and paperless.
    
## Features:
### Browsing the Courses in English
The App provides a list of all the english courses available as well as a search function.
This way students can look for courses everywhere they are.
